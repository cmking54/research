# Convex

This is the repository housing the codebase and documentation working towards answering our research question. Our research aims to develop a method of object detection that can be done more dynamically and intuitively than the current method of applied machine learning. While the 'machine learning' approach is more efficient and effective, the work produced from our experimental endeavor may gleam information of other approaches and possess key influences needed to understand the technique of object detection.

As discovering any object in a scene can be daunting to start with, we have narrowed our base case to detecting the human silhouette by using 'hints' from the scene to make assumptions of what may be there. For example, finding a hand may be difficult due to its abnormal shape and varying form, but finding the less dynamic and simplier silhouette of the head may give reasonable dimensions to confine the hand. This form of body proportions is a modern revival of the architectural works of Vitruvius and Da Vinci, as well as an application of common body-drawing practices used by artists.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

For now, to run this system, simply use:
```
python client.py <video_to_be_processed>
```
See prerequisties for dependencies.
